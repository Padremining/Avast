# Avast
here you will find the direct install file for avast anti-virus software. 
double click the .exe file and avast will start installing on your computer


** very important after avast is installed when you download the xmrig or 
   NB miner, avast will pop up with saying the file is bad, just select all 
   and then press the 3 dots and click restore and create exception, if you 
   dont do that then you will not be able to run the miner and avast will 
   delete the miner.***
